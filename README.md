Kin+Carta backend coding challenge

Framework: .NET 6.0

Test & Run:
- To debug, just open the solution and run.
- To run properly, you must have a mySql instance (connection string is in appsettings) and update it with the migrations.
- API is documented by Swagger, run the app to see what you can do with it
- To test uploading images use the conversion to string of the image encoded in Base64 (you can do it from: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image/png) 

In case of deploy, the appsettings.release should be completed with a properly connection string
